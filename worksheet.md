## Introduction to Git and GitHub

**Git** is the version control system we'll use to track changes in our code, while **GitHub** is the platform where we'll host our code repositories online. Since your coursework must be submitted via GitHub, a solid understanding of both is necessary for this module.

The following free courses from GitHub will get you up to speed:

### Introduction to GitHub

This course covers the basics of creating repositories, committing changes, working with branches, and using pull requests.

### Getting Started with GitHub Copilot

Learn how to use GitHub's AI pair programmer to write code faster. As a student, you're eligible for a free Copilot subscription through the [**GitHub Student Developer Pack**](https://education.github.com/pack).

## Introduction to the Dart Language

**Dart** is the programming language developed by Google. It is a statically typed language, compiled to native code, language with C-style syntax. Even though it may not be as popular as languages like C or Java, it is the language of the Flutter framework which we will be using for cross-platform app development in this module. Below are the resources from our first-year Programming module that will get you started with Dart.

## Exercises

Complete the exercises below and show your work to a member of staff present at your next practical for **a sign-off**.

1.  Your GitHub profile is your developer portfolio. As a small but important step, personalise your profile by adding a profile picture. Then write a short, one-line bio about yourself.

2.  Follow the instructions on [this document](https://portdotacdotuk-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/mani_ghahremani_port_ac_uk/ERXv27njJSZBsmQd5zCrGAMBvuuicqakKSQAk47e0IKf5g) to install Dart SDK and Visual Studio Code on your computer.

    Next, get [the GitHub for student pack](https://education.github.com/pack) and install the **GitHub Copilot** extension in Visual Studio Code. For more information, check out [this section](#introduction-to-git-and-github) of this worksheet.

    Install the **GitHub Copilot** extension in VS Code. Finally, make a Dart file, e.g., `hello_dart.dart` and use Copilot. You can, for example, add a comment to ask Copilot to write a new function for you:

    ````text
    ```dart
    // a function that returns the sum of two integers
    ```
    ````
