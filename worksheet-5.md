## **Introduction to Data Models**

So far, we've been passing simple data types like `String` and `int` between our widgets. As our app grows in complexity, it's better to group related data into custom data types (classes). We call these **data models**.

If you've worked with databases before, you can think of data models as being similar to **entities**. An entity is a real-world object or concept that can be distinctly identified. In our case, a "Sandwich" is a perfect example of an entity that we can represent with a data model.

### **Creating the `Sandwich` model**

Let's start by defining a `Sandwich` model. This will help us manage all the properties of a sandwich in one place.

In your `lib` folder, create a new folder called `models`. Inside this folder, create a new file called `sandwich.dart`. This is what your project structure may look like:

```
lib/
  â”œâ”€â”€ views/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app_styles.dart
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.dart
  â”œâ”€â”€ view_models/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ order_view_model.dart
  â”œâ”€â”€ models/
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sandwich.dart
  â””â”€â”€ repositories/
      â”œâ”€â”€ order_repository.dart
      â””â”€â”€ pricing_repository.dart
```

Add the following code to `sandwich.dart`:

```dart
enum BreadType { white, wheat, wholemeal }

class Sandwich {
  final String name;
  final bool isFootlong;
  final BreadType breadType;
  final String image;

  Sandwich({
    required this.name,
    required this.isFootlong,
    required this.breadType,
    required this.image,
  }) {
    if (name.isEmpty) {
      throw ArgumentError('Name cannot be empty');
    }
    if (image.isEmpty || !image.startsWith('assets/images/')) {
      throw ArgumentError('Image must be a valid asset path');
    }
  }
}
```

Here we have defined a `Sandwich` class with a few properties. The `image` property will hold the path to an image of the sandwich hence it is a `String`. We will come back to this later.

Does the `throw` statements make sense to you? If not, ask your AI assistant to explain them. Also, we are not storing the price of a sandwich here as it is determined by the `PricingRepository` based on the size of the sandwich (`isFootlong`).

Before moving on, use your AI assistant to write a unit test for the `Sandwich` model. Remember to create a `models` folder inside the `test` folder to mirror the structure of the `lib` folder. Your test file should ideally be named `sandwich_test.dart`.

#### **Commit your changes**

Here's a reminder to commit your changes (commit them individually, the addition of the model and the test).

### **The `Cart` model**

Now that we can represent a single sandwich, we need a way to manage a collection of them in an order. Provide your implementation of `Sandwich` class to Copilot or your AI assistant of choice and ask it to help you create a `Cart` class that can hold multiple `Sandwich` objects. Think about what operations the user might want to perform on a cart and specify them.

#### **Calculating the Cart's Total Price**

Since our `PricingRepository` is the single source of truth for all pricing logic, we should leverage it to calculate the total price of all sandwiches in the cart.

To do this, you may want to consider using collection types in `Cart` that allow you to store the sandwiches along with their quantities. This way, you can easily use the `calculatePrice` method from `PricingRepository` to compute the total price of the cart.

As with the `Sandwich` model, use your AI assistant to help you write unit tests for the `Cart` model. Ensure that the tests cover all the operations you have implemented including the total price calculation.

#### **Commit your changes**

Commit the addition of the `Cart` model and its tests before moving on.

## **Managing Assets**

Our `Sandwich` model has an `image` property, but we haven't provided any images yet. In Flutter, static files like images, fonts, and configuration files are called **assets**.

First, create an `assets` folder in the root of your project, at the same level as the `lib` and `test` folders. Inside the `assets` folder, create another folder called `images`.

Use your AI assistant to help you find or create images for the sandwiches or a logo for the app. Save these images in the `assets/images` folder. Name them appropriately, for example, `footlong_wheat.png`, `six_inch_wholemeal.png`, etc.

Next, you need to tell Flutter about these new assets. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file and add an `assets` section like this:

```yaml
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```

Make sure the indentation is correct, as `pubspec.yaml` is sensitive to whitespace. The line `assets:` should be at the same indentation level as `uses-material-design:`.

Now you can use these images in your app. For more information, you can read the official Flutter documentation on [adding assets and images](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/assets/assets-and-images).

#### **Commit your changes**

Commit your new assets with the message `Add sandwich images as assets`.

## **Updating the UI**

Now that we have our models and assets, let's update our UI to use them.

### **Updating the `OrderItemDisplay` widget**

Open `lib/views/main.dart` and update the `OrderItemDisplay` widget to display the sandwich image.

```dart
class OrderItemDisplay extends StatelessWidget {
  final Sandwich sandwich;
  final int quantity;
  final String orderNote;

  const OrderItemDisplay({
    super.key,
    required this.sandwich,
    required this.quantity,
    required this.orderNote,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    String displayText =
        '$quantity ${sandwich.breadType.name} ${sandwich.name} sandwich(es): ${'ðŸ¥ª' * quantity}';

    return Column(
      children: [
        Image.asset(sandwich.image),
        const SizedBox(height: 8),
        Text(
          displayText,
          style: normalText,
        ),
        const SizedBox(height: 8),
        Text(
          'Note: $orderNote',
          style: normalText,
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

### **Updating `_OrderScreenState`**

We need to refactor the `_OrderScreenState` to manage a list of different sandwiches in a cart. This is a significant change, so take your time to understand it. Use your AI assistant to help you answer questions like: "How do I use a `ListView.builder` to display a list of items?"

Here is the updated `_OrderScreenState`:

```dart
class _OrderScreenState extends State<OrderScreen> {
  final Cart _cart = Cart();
  final TextEditingController _notesController = TextEditingController();

  void _addSandwichToCart() {
    setState(() {
      _cart.add(
        Sandwich(
          name: 'Footlong',
          isFootlong: true,
          breadType: BreadType.wheat,
          image: 'assets/images/footlong.png',
        ),
      );
    });
  }

  void _removeSandwichFromCart(Sandwich sandwich) {
    setState(() {
      _cart.remove(sandwich);
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text(
          'Sandwich Counter',
          style: heading1,
        ),
      ),
      body: Column(
        children: [
          Expanded(
            child: ListView.builder(
              itemCount: _cart.items.length,
              itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                final sandwich = _cart.items[index];
                return ListTile(
                  leading: Image.asset(sandwich.image),
                  title: Text(sandwich.name),
                  subtitle: Text(sandwich.breadType.name),
                  trailing: IconButton(
                    icon: const Icon(Icons.remove_circle_outline),
                    onPressed: () => _removeSandwichFromCart(sandwich),
                  ),
                );
              },
            ),
          ),
          // We will add the rest of the UI back in later
        ],
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: _addSandwichToCart,
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

For now, we have simplified the UI to focus on the cart functionality. When you run the app, you will see a floating action button that adds a hardcoded "Footlong" sandwich to the cart. You can then remove sandwiches from the cart by tapping the remove icon.

#### **Commit your changes**

Commit your work with a message like `Implement cart functionality with data models`.

In the next worksheet, we will re-implement the UI for customising sandwiches and calculating the total price based on the items in the cart.
