# Flutter Worksheets

The worksheets for the Flutter module are listed below.

Complete them in order (do not skip the first one!).

Every worksheet ends with a handful of **exercises**.

After completing these exercises, show a member of staff your work for a **sign-off**.

**Each sign-off is worth 5%** of the coursework mark.

The **coursework is worth 50%** of your module mark and will be accessible on the Teaching Block 1 (TB1) section of the Moodle page.
